# GraphQL Go web application template

This repository contains a small web application using GraphQL and Go on the
backend and React with [Apollo Client][] in TypeScript for the frontend. It's
designed as a starting point for bootstrapping new web applications with Go and
TypeScript.

If you find issues, please report them on the [graphql-server issue tracker][].

## Getting Started

1. Use the GitHub web interface to [generate a repository][] based on
   this template.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Use the `set-project-name.sh` script to use your project name.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/MYNAME/PROJECT.git
cd PROJECT
./set-project-name.sh github.com/MYNAME/PROJECT
```

To run the app locally:

```shell
# In one terminal:
cd client && npm install && npm run watch

# In another terminal:
go build && ./graphql-go-app
```

You can also try this template out in Heroku:

-  [main.go][]: Server code. Can be broken up into multiple Go files, like with
   any Go package.
-  [main_test.go][]: Server test code
-  [client/src/components/App.tsx][]: Top-level `<App>` React component
-  [client/src/components/App.test.tsx][]: Unit tests for the `<App>` component
-  [client/dist/style.css][]: Stylesheet
-  [client/dist/index.html][]: Entrypoint for the TypeScript client application.
